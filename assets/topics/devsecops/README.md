# DevSecOps
This directory is dedicated to solutions, whitepapers, and trainings related to running DevSecOps solutions on Azure.
There will be a particular focus will be on the [US Department of Defense's DevSecOps Reference Architectures](https://dodcio.defense.gov/Library/), due to their wide-applicability and adoption anywhere code needs to be securely developed, delivered, and operated.
However, this section will not be limited to DOD DSOP, if other solutions or patterns emerge.

## Containers & Kubernetes

Many of the solutions described here will employ [Containers](../containers/README.md) and [Kubernetes](../kubernetes/README.md).
See those folders for specific content related to those topic areas.
The intent of this content is to explore DevSecOps platforms and patterns leveraging these and other technologies.
